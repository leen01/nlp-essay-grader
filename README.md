# Essay Score Prediction

## Summary
For the semester project, we explored creating a machine learning model to automate essay scoring using supervised learning technology. The input data was a string containing the entire student essay and the output data were 6 metrics for how well the student did on topics such as grammar, vocabulary, and other english metrics. We performed exploratory data analysis and iterated our machine learning model using interesting findings. Our final model produced an accuracy of 36.7% and the best model the competition produced was 43.3%.
